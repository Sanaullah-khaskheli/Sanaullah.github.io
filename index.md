## Hi, I’m Sanaullah

I am a **Master of Science in Computer Science** student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**, with a background in **Electrical Engineering** from **Sukkur IBA University**. My academic journey began with embedded systems and automation and gradually evolved toward **AI, robotics, and intelligent systems**.

After graduating, I stepped into academia as a **Robotics and AI Instructor**, where teaching and mentoring students sparked my curiosity about real-world intelligent systems. Later, my role as a **Research Associate** further strengthened my interest in **machine learning, NLP, and applied AI research**.

Two experiences played a key role in my transition to Computer Science:

- **Teaching Robotics & AI** – Deepened my understanding of AI-driven automation and intelligent systems.  
- **AI-based Flood Alert Chatbot** – Provided hands-on exposure to NLP, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making in real-world applications.
